##Background


##Summary
- Huck and Tom went on a path among the woods to leave Douglas's garden; however, Douglas's slave Jim quickly noticed their presence as Huck triped on a root and walked around to see what's going on.
- Upon hiding themselves carefully, Huck felt extreme itches all over the body but managed to not making any sound
- Jim fell asleep after a while; H&T got out quietly, and Huck convinced Tom to not do anything over the top
- Tom went to fetch some candles from the kitchen and left 5 cents as payment; He also put Jim's hat over a branch above him
- Afterward, according to Huck, Jim told others about this event over and over again and regarded this as the work of witches
- H&T met up with other boys and went to the cave, where they started a new band of robbers by the name of *Tom Sawyerâ€™s Gang*. Every members of the band had to sign a blood oath and promised not to tell the secrets; those who did shall have their families killed
- Other boys insisted to rule out the Huck as his dad had gone missing for monthes, and it wouldn't be fair for others if Huck was free from punishment. As a replacement, Huck's offer of Mrs. Watson was approved by the boys

> Jim was most **ruined for a servant**, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.
