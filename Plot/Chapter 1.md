> "... When [Huck] got to the table [he] couldn't go right to eating,
but [he] had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble
a little over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the
matter with them, ——— that is, **nothing only everything was cooked by
itself**. In a barrel of odds and ends it is **different**; things get mixed
up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better."

**Interpretation**: Huck suggests that the quality of this meal is degraded due to the way Douglas cooks these foods ———— she cooks them separately, instead of put them all in one big pot such that the flavors of each ingredients involved can be combined and mixed together perfectly to create a more tasty dish. Throughout the quote, the ideas of being "separate" and "together" can also be seen as an implied reference to racial segregation in America. Metaphorically speaking, Twain is hinting that once people of different races learn to live and understand each other, our world would turn out to be a better place.
