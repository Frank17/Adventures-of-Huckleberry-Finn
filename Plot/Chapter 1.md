## Background
- Huck and Tom (main character in the book *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer*; Huck's best friend) got a considerable fortune of $6000 apiece through an adventure, and the local judge Thatcher promised to give them each one dollar per day while keeping the rest in the bank
- A widow by the name of Douglas took Huck as her son and let him live with her

## Summary
- Dougals tried to "sivilize" Huck and make him behave like a decent boy; However, Huck hated to be bound by these rules and managed to break them whenver he had a chance
- Miss Watson, Dougals's sister, had came to live with them and put on even stricter rules and educations Huck had to listen to
- When Huck went to bed, he felt everything was hopeless and mournful. He then killed a spider by accident, which convinced him that bad luck had came for him
- To Huck's surprise, his buddy Tom was right outside and gave him signals. He quckly climbed over the wall to met Tom

## Interesting ideas
> "... when [Huck] couldn't stand it longer [he] lit out. [Huck] got into
[his] old rags and [his] sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied."

**Interpretation**: Im too lazy to write this down today. It's either tomorrow, Wednesday or never.

> "... When [Huck] got to the table [he] couldn't go right to eating,
but [he] had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble
a little over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the
matter with them, ——— that is, **nothing only everything was cooked by
itself**. In a barrel of odds and ends it is **different**; things get
mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better."

**Interpretation**: Huck suggests that the quality of this meal is somewhat degraded due to the way Douglas cooks these foods ——— she cooks them separately, instead of putting everything in one big pot such that the flavor of every ingredient involved can be combined and mixed together perfectly to create a more tasty dish. Throughout the quote, the idea of being "separate" and "together" can also be seen as an implied reference to racial segregation around mid-1800s to 1900s in America. Metaphorically speaking, Twain is hinting that once people of different races learn to live and understand each other, our world will turn out to be a better place.
